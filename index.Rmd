Welcome to An Introduction to Data Science Methods in Education! The overarching goal of this course is to support graduate-level students across the [Department of Theory and Practice in Teacher Education](https://tpte.utk.edu/) (and the [Bailey Graduate School of Education](https://gse.utk.edu/about-gse/)) at the [University of Tennessee, Knoxville](http://utk.edu/) to be empowered to use new data sources and research methods in their research.

Note: This class is designed as a fully online and partially synchronous course. We will meet synchronously every week via Zoom on Thursdays 2:50-4:05 pm.

This class will be taught in a fully-online format. We will use Zoom for synchronous (or at-the-same-time) a) introductions to new content, b) “try-it-out” laboratories, and c) discussions. We will also use a number of tools for asynchronous communication, especially [Slack (click for link to our class Slack workspace)](https://datascienceinedu.slack.com/).
