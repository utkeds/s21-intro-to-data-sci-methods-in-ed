# Individual Final Project

### Overview

This assignment involves identifying and describing a data science resource as a part of a class resource throughout the semester.

### Details

While you work on your final project, you are very likely going to be doing some independent research. This independent research may lead you to resources, R packages, or even individuals who you found very helpful. This assignment is an opportunity for you, individually, and us, as a class, to share these resources with each other, students in future classes, and anyone interested!

### Process, Timeline and Due Date, and How to Submit

- By 5/5 (anytime before is fine!), add your resource to the R Markdown document in the repository for this website:
  https://github.com/making-data-science-count/s21-intro-to-data-sci-methods-in-ed/blob/main/curated-data-science-resources.Rmd

- To add this, you will need to first create a GitHub account. You can do so here: http://github.com/

- Then, make your edit directly in the document. Review the Week 11 recording for instructions on how to do this (and do not hesitate to reach out with any questions; using GitHub is tricky!)

- Once you've done this, we'll review your "pull request", and you're good to go!
