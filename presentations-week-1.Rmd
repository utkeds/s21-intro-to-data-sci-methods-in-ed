## Course FAQ

.pull-left-wide[
**Q - What data science background does this course assume?**  
A - None.

**Q - Is this an intro stat course?**  
A - While statistics $\ne$ data science, they are very closely related and have tremendous of overlap. Hence, this course is a great way to get started with statistics. However this course is *not* your typical high school statistics course.

**Q - Will we be doing computing?**   
A - Yes.

# What we learned from your survey responses (thank you!)

- Everyone uses spreadsheet software
- You're (mostly) confident that you can solve problems with respect to analyzing 
data, but are less confident with respect to using statistical software
- Most of you have used data analysis notebooks (RMarkdown?)
- You have impressive backgrounds and professional experiences
- For many, programming and using statistics correctly can be intimidating
- You're a bit more interested in preparing data for analyses than we thought (cool!)

---

# Objectives

By the end of the session, participants will be able to:

1. Develop confidence going forward in you ability to analyze data as a part of your program
1. Be able to visualize educational data.
1. Use linear (regression) models as a general-purpose tool for data analysis.
1. Explore some of the more data science-related aspects of R through text analysis

---

# Pedagogical framework

*Constructivist*

You'll be involved in the process of building new capabilities (and knowledge and skills) with support from others and carefully-chosen scaffolds.

1. Each of the four sessions will be organized around a big idea
1. You will be doing a great deal of the work
1. Then, we will discuss what we did and how it applies

---

# Over-arching design

The pedagogical framework *plays out* in the following specific ways:

1. You'll first see some brief examples to give you a sense of what's possible
1. You'll be using R Markdown to try things out
1. You'll have a chance to share your ideas and thoughts about what you've done; it will also give me a chance to hear from you about what you did

---

# Agenda

### *Part 1: Getting up and running*
### Part 2: Visualizing and exploring data
### Part 3: Modeling and understanding data
### Part 4: Doing more with data science

# Background on R and RStudio

---

# A little motivation theory

## Expectancy-value theory

- We choose things that we are *confident* that we can do well and that are *valuable* to us

- We do these in a sociocultural *context*: our sense of belonging impacts what we choose to do

---

# An argument about RMarkdown

- This presentation will make the argument that **you can use R and RStudio to solve
problems that are important to you**

- In doing so, you can **participate in a cool community of data scientists in education**

---

# Why learn R?

* It is capable of carrying out basic and complex statistical analyses
* It is able to work with data small (*n* = 30) and large (*n* = 100,000+) efficiently
* It is a programming language and so is quite flexible
* There is a great, inclusive community of users and developers (and teachers)
* It is increasingly used in education
* It can help you to carry out your educational analyses in open and trustworthy ways
* It is cross-platform, open-source, and freely-available

# Where You'll Be Running R

RStudio Cloud (preferred)  
OR  
R and RStudio on your computer  

---

# RStudio Cloud

**[This link will take you to the RStudio Cloud project for this part of the session](https://rstudio.cloud/project/964811).**

Link also here: https://rstudio.cloud/project/964811

Once you have navigated to this webpage, log in using a Google or GitHub account. Then, create a permanent copy of the project in your own workspace (see the prompt at the top of the page guiding you to do this).

From here, you can write and run R code exactly as your would through RStudio on your computer.
---

# R and RStudio

**If you like, you may (of course!) use R and RStudio**

To download R:
* [Visit this page to download R](https://cran.r-project.org/)
* Find your operating system (Mac, Windows, or Linux)
* Download the 'latest release' on the page for your operating system and download and install the application

To download RStudio:
* [Visit this page to download RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
* Find your operating system (Mac, Windows, or Linux)
* Download the 'latest release' on the page for your operating system and download and install the application

# Try it out! Getting started with RStudio

Activities:  

Running a single RMarkdown chunk  
Running another RMarkdown chunk  
Rendering an RMarkdown document to a PDF  
Creating your first visualization

---

# RMarkdown

* RMarkdown is a data analysis "notebook" that combines text with code and output
* It is a great file type to use when beginning to use R and to create reproducible analyses
* It is fun to use because you can generate different types of output (Word, PDF, and even web-based)

# Let's look at a bit of code together

What do you think this code will do?

```{r, eval = FALSE}
sci_mo_processed %>% 
  filter(percentage_earned >= .60) %>% 
  select(student_id, course_id, percentage_earned))
```

# Let's look at a bit of code together

# Running a single RMarkdown chunk 

Let's hop over to the "demo doc" for part 1!

[`demo-doc-1-setting-up.Rmd`](demo-doc-1-setting-up.Rmd)

Let's run the first chunk by clicking the green arrow in the first code chunk.

If you saw the message "It worked!", congratulations - it worked!

---

# Running another RMarkdown chunk  

After running one chunk, we can easily run the next chunk. 

What happens when you print the second chunk (with `sci_mo_processed`)?

---

# Working through the remainder of the document

(We'll work together through a few sections of the document in this phase)

---

# Rendering an RMarkdown document to a PDF  

Have you made it to the end of the document? 

Now, we'll render to a PDF.
