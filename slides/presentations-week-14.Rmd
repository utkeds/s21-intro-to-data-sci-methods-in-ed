# Breakout rooms!

Starting with whomever likes classical music the most:

- What is one thing you are proud of accomplishing this semester related to using R/this class?
- What is an R- or data science-related goal that you have beyond this class?

---

## A recap of last week

- The map() functions can help you to read in multiple files

- Cases with missing values can still be used

### Topics for today

**Record the meeting** 

- A. Introduction to digital research methods: Network and text analysis
- B. Looking ahead: where to next?
- C. Some (data-based) reflections

---

### A. Digital research methods

Now is a good time to be studying social media (or exploring social media data as a hobby)

Facebook and Twitter have programs that allow accesss to researchers, including
graduate students:

- Facebook and Instagram: https://research.fb.com/blog/2020/07/crowdtangle-opens-public-application-for-academics/
- Twitter: https://developer.twitter.com/en/solutions/academic-research

---

### A. Digital research methods

There is a general _pattern_ for how to access social media (and other!) data using R:

1. Apply for access to an "Application Programming Interface", or API, for a platform (or website)
1. Receive an API key automatically/within a few days
1. Use/enter the API key within R
1. Access data

---

### A. Digital research methods

**An example**

AERA was recognized as quite unsuccessful this year; the organizers offered a full refund
to all attendees due to technical difficulties

A parody account helped to bring levity to the situation: https://twitter.com/AeraHelpers

But, just how negative were posts about AERA on social media (Twitter)? We can use digital (or data science) research methods, those that would be hard or impossible to do without coding/using R.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(academictwitteR)

all_ngsschat_tweets <- get_hashtag_tweets("#AERA21", "2010-01-01T00:00:00Z", "2020-12-31T00:00:00Z", bearer_token = "replace with your token from https://developer.twitter.com")
```

---

### A. Digital research methods

There are a number of ways to "hide" your token so you don't have to repeatedly type it.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(usethis)
edit_r_environ() # bearer_token = "xxx"

all_ngsschat_tweets <- get_hashtag_tweets("#AERA21", "2010-01-01T00:00:00Z", "2020-12-31T00:00:00Z", bearer_token = Sys.getenv("bearer_token"))
```

---

### A. Digital research methods

Once we have the data, there are a number of things we can do. Let's collect data
for a different hashtag; in fact, a collection of hashtags.

```{r}
hashtags_to_search <- c(str_c("#AERA", 14:21), str_c("AERA20", 14:21)) %>% 
  str_c(collapse = " OR ")

hashtags_to_search
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
all_aera_tweets <- c(str_c("#AERA", 14:21), str_c("AERA20", 14:21)) %>% 
  map(get_hashtag_tweets, "2010-01-01T00:00:00Z", "2021-04-17T00:00:00Z", bearer_token = Sys.getenv("bearer_token"), data_path = "twitter-data-aera/")
```

---

### A. Digital research methods

```{r, include = FALSE}
all_aera_tweets <- read_rds(here("data", "aera-tweets.rds"))
```

**Big idea: We can treat text like other types of data**

```{r}
all_aera_tweets
```

---

### A. Digital research methods

**Big idea: We can treat text like other types of data**

```{r}
library(tidytext)

all_aera_tweets_words <- all_aera_tweets %>% 
  select(created_at, text) %>% 
  unnest_tokens(word, text)

all_aera_tweets_words
```

---

### A. Digital research methods

**Sentiment analysis is as straightforward as _joining_ a pre-identified collection of positive and negative words - a dictionary**

```{r}
all_aera_tweets_words %>%
  inner_join(get_sentiments("bing"))
```
---

### A. Digital research methods

**A different dictionary; from these, we can summarize and visualize the sentiment scores**

```{r}
all_aera_tweets_words %>%
  inner_join(get_sentiments("afinn"))
```
---

### A. One way of representing the results

**Using the bing dictionary; see [academic-twitter-example.R](https://github.com/making-data-science-count/s21-intro-to-data-sci-methods-in-ed/blob/main/academic-twitter-example.R)**

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/aera-sentiment-by-year.png")
```

---

### A. Digital research methods

This analysis invites a number of questions:

- Was AERA really not that much more negative than in years past? Or, is there sone difference?
- Is there an effect of the dictionary selected; is the "bing" dictionary not detecting the _type_ of negativity in these short, social media-based posts?
- Were negative posts this year interacted with more than positive posts?
- Could a qualitative analysis reveal nuances between positive and negative labeled posts?
- How does AERA compare to other conferences, like [LAK](https://twitter.com/markwarschauer/status/1383127840313413633), that appeared to have been better received?

### B. Looking ahead

There are so many things you can do! 

Some broad suggestions, first:

- It’s normal to feel overwhelmed while learning skills like R and data science; adopt a long-term, growth approach (or mindset) to learning R
- Surround yourself with resources
- Ask for help!
  - Peers and us (we're part of your R network now!)
- Share with others
  - Peers and us!
- Welcome others

---

### B. Looking ahead

We also have some specific suggestions:

- Ask and receive help via the RStudio Community: https://community.rstudio.com/
- create a blog with blogdown: https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/
- Twitter and [#rstats](https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats?lang=en)
- [R Weekly](http://rweekly.org/)
- R for Data Science: https://r4ds.had.co.nz/
- Twitter users:
  - @ivelasq
  - @kierisi
  - @ry_estrellado
  - @efreer20
  - @hadleywickham
- Other resources: https://datascienceineducation.com/c18.html

---

### B. Looking ahead

- Research presentations and papers that you lead or co-author
- Workshops/training opportunities at UTK and beyond
- Job opportunities (Skill with R is in-demand at present)
- Other courses at UTK
  - . . . including those offered within TPTE (Josh and Alex's department; consider the graduate certificate)

---

### C. Some reflections

- Teaching this class has been an amazing experience

- We are really thankful for your ambition, persistence, and positivity

- Kudos to you all

---

### C. Some reflections

We are learning, too; we learned a lot:

- Assigning base groups!
- Make the class _longer_
- You can do ambitious work early on; emphasize early
- Keep homework relatively narrow, focused, and self-contained
- Emphasize projects/authentic contexts earlier and more next time
- Small technical issues can present headaches; use R Studio Cloud (early)?

---

### C. Some reflections

**See [exit-ticket-analysis.R](https://github.com/making-data-science-count/s21-intro-to-data-sci-methods-in-ed/blob/main/exit-ticket-analysis.R)**

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/class-mean-responses.png")
```

---

### C. Some reflections

Take-aways from the homework reflections:

- Interest and value remained relatively high for most of you (with substantial between-individual and some between-assignment variation)
- Challenge was moderate throughout, with some peaks that we may wish to avoid (or provide support/instruction around)
- Your comments when submitting the homework were great as a barometer for us
- The same is true for your end-of-class check-outs
- Data science is hard; teaching it is fun and hard in some ways, too; thanks for 
sticking it through and for remaining upbeat

---

### C. Some reflections

**Other highlights**

- Kudos to everyone dealing with the pandemic; it has been a challenging time - at best
- Special kudos to our mathematics teachers
- Special kudos to anyone who was caring for oneself or others this semester
- Let's move forward knowing that we can get through this challenging time, hopefully stronger in some ways

## Data Science Certificate

A bit more detail on our plans:

- We'll start Fall, 2021 (Spring, 2022 would be the next relevant class for you; certificate will likely be approved by this time)
- Can complete within two years
- Will allow for one eligible course to be replaced with another computationally-focused/data science
class that you have taken or will taken; _so, you will need to only take three of the four classes to
complete the certificate_

```{r, echo = FALSE}
readxl::read_excel("../data/ds-cert.xlsx") %>% 
  knitr::kable()
